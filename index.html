    <h3>BIO</h3>
    Jacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), known professionally as Travis Scott (formerly stylized Travi$ Scott), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Throughout his career, Scott has achieved four number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, along with 80 total charted songs. Scott has been nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won a Billboard Music Award, Latin Grammy Award, MTV Video Music Award, and multiple BET Hip Hop Awards. As of 2020, Scott has sold over 45 million certified records in the US alone. Scott's musical style has been described as a "blend between traditional hip-hop and lo-fi" and often characterized as "ambient," with a heavily appraised influence from rappers Kanye West and Kid Cudi. His stage name is derived from the latter (whose real name is Scott Mescudi) combined with the name of a favorite uncle.
    In 2012, Scott signed his first major-label recording contract with Epic Records, and a publishing deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music as an in-house producer. In April 2013, he entered a joint-venture record deal with American rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records. Scott self-released his first full-length project, a mixtape titled Owl Pharaoh, in 2013, which was followed with a mixtape titled Days Before Rodeo, in 2014. His debut studio album, Rodeo (2015) was released to critical praise and moderate commercial success. The album preceded by the singles "3500" (featuring Future and 2 Chainz) and "Antidote"; the latter of which became his first hit song, peaking at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016), became his first number-one album on the Billboard 200 chart. The following year, Scott released a collaborative album with rapper Quavo, titled Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, under the group name Huncho Jack.

    In 2018, his third album, Astroworld, was released to critical acclaim and also reached the top spot of the Billboard 200. Additionally, the album produced his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, "Sicko Mode" (featuring Drake).[10] In late 2019, Scott's vanity label imprint, Cactus Jack Records, released the compilation album JackBoys, which also topped the Billboard 200. After the release of his single "Franchise" (featuring Young Thug and M.I.A.) in 2020, Scott became the first artist on the Hot 100 to have three songs debut at number one in less than a year.[11] Five years after the release of his third album, Scott released his highly anticipated follow-up Utopia, becoming his fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200.

    Over the course of his career, Scott has become a globally recognized artist and pop culture figure. Along with his highly publicized relationship with American media personality Kylie Jenner, Scott has collaborated with organizations including Nike, Dior, and McDonald's. In 2017, he founded the record label Cactus Jack Records. Scott has also gained notoriety for controversies and legal issues regarding safety at his concerts. In November 2021, a mass-casualty crowd crush occurred during Scott's performance at the Astroworld Festival in his hometown of Houston, Texas, resulting in some condemnation of the artist.
